Functions of all the scripts in ../code

extract_trend.py
----------------

Takes 1 argument, the data file. The data file should be in the following format:

name
x1,y1
x2,y2
...
xn,yn

The script will fit four functions to the data: linear, exponential, log, and
log(log), and will output the chosen function along with the parameters for
that function. For function f, the parameters output are a and b, such that
y = af(x) + b.
